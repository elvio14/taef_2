    I designed and developed this Linux terminal that allows users to easily manage multiple terminal windows each with
    customizable title and color hue simply by click-and-drag on the color slider. I used egui and winit for the GUI
    and ptyprocess to handle pseudoterminals. Some features are still on the backlog, such as handling copy-paste and path autocomplete.
